        "This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aims to understand the structure, trends, and relationships within a comprehensive automobile dataset. The dataset includes various car attributes such as price, engine specifications, fuel type, body style, number of cylinders, and performance metrics like mileage and horsepower. The objective was to prepare the data for analysis, uncover hidden patterns, and derive actionable insights for business decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "We started with data cleaning by identifying and replacing missing or inconsistent values, converting data types, and handling special characters like '?'. Numeric columns with missing data were imputed using median values, while categorical columns were cleaned and transformed for consistency. Special attention was given to transforming textual representations (e.g., “four”, “six”) into numerical formats to enable analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "We performed extensive visual exploration using bar plots, box plots, scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps. These charts revealed that variables like engine size, horsepower, and curb weight are positively correlated with car price. In contrast, fuel efficiency (measured in city and highway MPG) tends to be higher in lower-priced cars.\n",
        "\n",
        "Further analysis showed that body style, aspiration type (turbo vs standard), drive wheels, and fuel type significantly affect the vehicle's market value. We also examined brand-specific trends, observing that luxury brands typically dominate the higher price segments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on our findings, we proposed actionable strategies such as segmentation of customers, feature-based pricing, and optimization of product offerings. These insights can directly support pricing strategies, customer targeting, and feature prioritization in product development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project demonstrates the critical role of EDA in transforming raw, unstructured data into a refined dataset that provides valuable business insights. It sets a strong foundation for future tasks like predictive modeling or deeper market analysis."

It has 205 rows and 26 columns, including both numerical and categorical variables such as make, fuel type, engine size, horsepower, and price. Several columns originally contained missing values represented by \"?\", which were successfully replaced with NaN. After cleaning, seven columns still have missing data, including normalized-losses, num-of-doors, bore, stroke, horsepower, peak-rpm, and price. Numerical columns vary widely, indicating potential for modeling and analysis, while some like compression-ratio show signs of outliers. The dataset is well-suited for tasks such as exploratory data analysis and building machine learning models for price prediction, provided missing values are handled and categorical variables are properly encoded."
